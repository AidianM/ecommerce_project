#using a feature of SpringBoot called "hidden method filters" - normally, when we have an HTML form, we can only submit with the methdos GET and POST from
#within HTML; SB has a feature where you can tell SB to use "simulated" post/put/patch requests via form requests that uses a hidden form field to specify how
#the request should process. 

#In order to enable this feature, we need the following:
spring.mvc.hiddenmethod.filter.enabled = true 

#show sql queries in console:
spring.jpa.show-sql = true

#update ddl when app starts:
#spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
